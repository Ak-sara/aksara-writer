# AksaraDraw Visual Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Update:** Layout and styling enhancements

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Overlapping Nodes ✅

**Problem:** Nodes were overlapping, especially in complex hierarchies like:
- "Manager Development" and "Manager Akuntansi"
- "Manager Treasury" positions

**Solution:** Rewrote tree layout algorithm with proper width-aware positioning:
- Added `subtreeWidth` tracking to calculate actual space needed for each subtree
- Implemented minimum node gap of 30px between siblings
- Nodes now positioned based on actual widths rather than uniform spacing
- Added shift detection to prevent parent nodes from overlapping left boundary

**Before:**
```
Manager Development     Manager Akuntansi    Manager Treasury
[====overlapping====]   [===overlapping===]
```

**After:**
```
Manager Development    Manager Akuntansi    Manager Treasury
[=====] [30px gap] [=====] [30px gap] [=====]
```

### 2. Improved Spacing Calculation ✅

**Changes:**
- Removed fixed `spacingX` parameter (was 150px)
- Dynamic spacing based on node widths and subtree requirements
- Minimum gap of 30px between any adjacent nodes
- Parent nodes centered over children's actual positions

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Calculate total width needed
totalChildrenWidth = sum(child.subtreeWidth for each child)
totalChildrenWidth += (numberOfChildren - 1) * minGap

// Use larger of: node width or children width
subtreeWidth = max(nodeWidth, totalChildrenWidth)
```

### 3. Reduced Arrow Stroke Width ✅

**Before:**
- Stroke width: 2px
- Color: black (#000)
- Arrowhead: 10x10px

**After:**
- Stroke width: 1.5px (25% thinner)
- Color: #666 (softer gray)
- Arrowhead: 8x8px (20% smaller)

**Impact:** Arrows are less visually dominant, diagram looks cleaner

### 4. Implemented Curved Arrows ✅

**Before:** Straight lines
```typescript
<line x1="..." y1="..." x2="..." y2="..."/>
```

**After:** Smooth Bézier curves
```typescript
<path d="M x1,y1 C cx1,cy1 cx2,cy2 x2,y2"/>
```

**Curve calculation:**
```typescript
const dy = y2 - y1;
const controlPointOffset = Math.abs(dy) * 0.5;

// Control points for smooth vertical curves
const cx1 = x1;
const cy1 = y1 + controlPointOffset;
const cx2 = x2;
const cy2 = y2 - controlPointOffset;
```

**Visual effect:** Arrows now flow naturally, especially for hierarchical layouts

## Visual Comparison

### Organization Chart
**Before:**
- Overlapping nodes
- Bold straight arrows
- Cramped appearance

**After:**
- Clean separation between all nodes
- Elegant curved arrows
- Professional, tidy layout
- Proper spacing for Indonesian business labels

### Example Output

```
              Direktur Utama
             /       |       \
           /         |         \
         /           |           \
   Direktur      Direktur      Direktur
   Teknologi     Keuangan      Operasional
     /  \           /  \
    /    \         /    \
Manager  Manager Manager Manager
  IT    Development Akuntansi Treasury
```

All nodes properly spaced with no overlaps!

## Technical Improvements

### Code Changes

**packages/core/src/aksara-draw/layouts/tree.ts:**
- Added `subtreeWidth` property to TreeNode
- Removed fixed spacing parameters
- Implemented width-aware positioning algorithm
- Added `shiftSubtree()` method for boundary correction

**packages/core/src/aksara-draw/renderer.ts:**
- Changed `<line>` to `<path>` with Bézier curves
- Reduced stroke width to 1.5px
- Changed color to #666
- Reduced arrowhead marker size to 8x8px
- Adjusted arrowhead refX/refY for proper positioning

### Performance Impact

- **Layout calculation:** Still O(n) complexity
- **No performance degradation:** Curve calculation is trivial
- **Bundle size:** No change (~5KB)

## Test Results

### test/AksaraDrawTest.md

✅ Organization Chart (3 levels, 7 nodes):
- All nodes properly spaced
- No overlaps
- Curved arrows flowing smoothly
- Width: 1008.8px (auto-calculated based on content)

✅ Simple Org Chart (2 levels, 3 nodes):
- Compact and centered
- Proper spacing maintained
- Width: 220.4px (minimal, no wasted space)

✅ Visual Quality:
- Professional appearance
- Tidy arrangement
- Easy to read
- Suitable for business documents

## User Feedback Addressed

| Issue | Status | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Overlapping between Manager nodes | ✅ Fixed | Width-aware layout algorithm |
| Distance calculation needs better strategy | ✅ Fixed | Dynamic spacing based on actual node widths |
| Placement arrangement not tidy | ✅ Fixed | Proper centering and gap management |
| Arrows too bold | ✅ Fixed | Reduced to 1.5px, softer color |
| Want nicely curved arrows | ✅ Fixed | Bézier curve implementation |

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ All issues resolved
- ✅ Ready for production use

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Configurable arrow style:**
   - Stroke width parameter
   - Curve intensity control
   - Color customization

2. **Advanced layout options:**
   - Configurable minimum gap
   - Horizontal vs vertical optimization
   - Compact mode for small diagrams

3. **Shape padding customization:**
