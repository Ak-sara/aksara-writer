## VS Code: Smart Preview

The Aksara Writer VS Code extension provides a smart preview feature that automatically detects if a markdown file has Aksara directives.

### Usage

When you open a markdown file, the extension will check for the `aksara:true` directive. If it's present, it will open the Aksara Writer preview. Otherwise, it will open the default VS Code markdown preview.

You can also trigger the smart preview manually by right-clicking on a markdown file and selecting "Open Preview".
