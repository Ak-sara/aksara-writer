## Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Missing directive block**: Documents must start with `<!-- aksara:true -->`
2. **Invalid image paths**: Use relative paths from document location
3. **CSS not loading**: Ensure style path is relative to document
4. **Font overflow**: Use responsive `clamp()` sizing for presentations
5. **Background not showing**: Check image path and positioning syntax
