## Section Classes

You can add custom CSS classes to sections in your document.

### Usage

To add a class to a section, add a comment with the following format:

```markdown
---
<!-- class:cover -->
# Cover Slide Content

---
<!-- class:quote -->
## Quote or Highlight Section

---
<!-- class:divider -->
### Section Divider
```

This will add the specified class to the section, allowing you to style it with custom CSS.
